## Study Planner
### What Does This Project Do
This program helps you to study better. According to your class schedule and school's academic calendar, this program creates a schedule for when to review your lectures.

### Why is This Project Useful?
This program suggests to review a lecture at least three times(a day, a week, and a month after you first listened to a lecture). It would encourage your academic achievement by ensuring the material stays in your (relatively) long term memory.

### Contribution
This project is from https://github.com/vitchyr/StudyPlanner

The original project creates a semester-long schedule with corresponding dates. I selected the schedules for a day, so that the user could easily recognize the day planner

I also made a webpage for checking daily schedule, in order to easily access. It automatically updates the schedule according to the current day.

To do this, I modified some codes to make the data appropriate for extracting, and for printing on a webpage, and created a makefile to make it easier. 

### Install Requirements

Every requisites are written in 'requirements.txt'
